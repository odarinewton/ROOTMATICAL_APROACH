This file contains the necessary information on the working and physics simulations on principles behind the workings of the device mentioned in the paper “THE TIME FORCE: A ROOTMATICAL APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING SPACE TIME” authored by Newton M. Odari under the supervision of Dr. Geoffrey O. Okengo.
This paper focuses on the possible variation of physical constants of nature with the gravitational constant under consideration, and the subsequent repercussions this has on the discipline itself. Furthermore, it extrapolates on the evolution of physical laws
